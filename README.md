This project is focused on developing a web application that provides weather forecasts by leveraging data from the external [Open weather map] API. Users can search for weather details for any location worldwide. Additionally, the application offers an automatic detection feature for the user's current location at startup, provided the user grants location access. 

Key features include caching weather data in both redux-store and session storage to minimize network requests, displaying maps for selected locations, and updating data synchronously to reflect the most current weather information. Users will enjoy interactive elements such as toast notifications for actions, a modal popup showcasing a seven-day weather forecast, and engaging zoom animations. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes.
